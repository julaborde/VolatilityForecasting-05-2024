# Volatility Modeling and Prediction

A comprehensive financial modeling project developed during CentraleSup√©lec's academic program (June 2024), focusing on volatility estimation, rough volatility modeling, and trading strategy development for SPY (S&P 500 ETF) financial time series.

## üìã Project Overview

This project explores advanced volatility modeling techniques to predict financial market volatility and develop trading strategies. The implementation combines classical econometric models with cutting-edge rough volatility theory to provide robust volatility forecasts.

### Key Objectives
- Model and predict volatility of SPY financial time series using multiple approaches
- Compare range-based volatility estimators with traditional methods
- Implement rough volatility models for enhanced prediction accuracy
- Develop and backtest trading strategies based on volatility forecasts

## üîß Technical Components

### Part I: Volatility Estimation
Implementation of multiple volatility estimators:

- **Close-to-Close Volatility**: Traditional estimators with zero and non-zero drift assumptions
- **Range-Based Estimators**:
  - Parkinson estimator (high-low range based)
  - Garman-Klass estimator (incorporating opening/closing prices)
  - Rogers-Satchell estimator (drift-robust)
  - Yang-Zhang estimator (accounts for opening jumps)

### Part II: Rough Volatility Modeling
Advanced modeling using fractional processes:

- **Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility (RFSV)** model implementation
- **Fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck** process for log-volatility dynamics
- Statistical analysis of volatility regularity and scaling properties
- Monofractality testing and Hurst parameter estimation

### Part III: Trading Strategy Development
Practical application of volatility predictions:

- Long/short position strategies based on volatility signals
- Performance metrics calculation (Sharpe Ratio, Drawdown)
- Risk quantification and strategy optimization
- Backtesting on historical SPY and VXX data
